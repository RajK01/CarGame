# SimpleCarGame 🚗

### 📍 Description: 
In this project, I have created a simple Video game with Pygame. I have used images of two cars. (My car and the Enemy car). The entire code I did on VS Code in python. It Increases the difficulty 
over time. And I have added an end game logic, when the cars collide it scores and shows you lost, game is over. I put an animation parameter through which we can increase or decrease the speed.
